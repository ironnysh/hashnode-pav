Are you reading this between meetings? Let me guess: If you’re a manager — you answered, “sure am”; if you’re a maker — you answered, “thankfully, no”

In his classic post [**_Maker’s schedule, manager’s schedule_**](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), Y Combinator founder Paul Graham describes these distinct approaches:

> “There are two types of schedule […] The manager’s schedule is for bosses […] with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you’re doing every hour.

> **When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon**”.

As CTO, my day is **fragmented into meetings** with my team or peers in _Project A_’s portfolio companies and dotted with administrative tasks. But as a maker — developer, designer, writer, take your pick— your job is profoundly different, and so is your calendar.

That’s why my calendar looks like a neatly-organized box of Legos, while my team’s calendars are **calm stretches of focus time**.

**This is the only way they can be creative and do their job.**

What does your calendar look like? [Let me know!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stephan-schulze_management-maker-manager-activity-6926800753080561664-GR4g)
